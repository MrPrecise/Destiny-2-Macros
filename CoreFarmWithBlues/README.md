# Core Farm With Blues

## Disclamer

Empty your class items into the bank or other characters. This script is meant to be used with 9 items only. If you have not 9 class item slots free **there will be a loss in items. I am not responsible in the loss of items.**

**Use macro at own risk!**

## Description
Way this macro works is to spend 777 glimmer to collect 9 items from your collections, for a total of 6993 glimmer. Then the script will individually upgrade each item from 5 to 8.

6500 Glimmer, 10 Legendary Shards and 1 Prism per class item that is taken out of your Collections. You will use cores in this process, 3 to to be exact but the process will give you back 6 cores. Making your total core per item 3 cores per leveled item. For each loop iteration will this be 3 * 9 = 27 cores. 

This will loop will run until a given resource is exhausted.
